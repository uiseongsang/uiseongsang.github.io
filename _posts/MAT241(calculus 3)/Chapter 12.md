# 12.1: Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems
    `Cartesian product` is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. 

    `The Cartesian product` R x R x R = ![image](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1We9Yti_rEGGkpsJcEthI6R8xJrjGwTB0) is the set of all ordered triples of real numbers and is denoted by R^3.
