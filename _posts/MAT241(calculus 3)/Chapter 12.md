# 12.1: Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems
    `Cartesian product` is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. 

    `The Cartesian product` R x R x R = ![image](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1We9Yti_rEGGkpsJcEthI6R8xJrjGwTB0) is the set of all ordered triples of real numbers and is denoted by R^3.

# 12.2: Vector
    The team `vector` is used by scientists to indicate a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.

## Combining Vectors

>> Definition vector Adiition
    If `u` and `v` are vectors positioned so the initial point of `v` is at the terminal point of `u`, then `sum u` + `v` is the vector from the initial point of `u` to the terminal point of `v`.

>> Definition of Scalar Multiplication
    If c is a scalar and `v` is a vector, then the `scalar multiple` c`v`is the vector whose length is |c| times the length of `v` and whose direction is the same as `v` if c > 0 and is opposite to `v` if c < 0. If c =0 or `v = 0`, then c`v` = 0.
