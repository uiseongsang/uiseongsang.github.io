An electroscope is a scientific instrument used to detect the presence and magnitude of electric charge on a body. It was the first electrical measuring instrument.

# Investigation #2    
    >> intro
        One of the important issues in constructing a charge diagram is knowing the excess charge on an object

## Three different subatomic particles
    1. Protons (양성자)
        Protons carry a type of charge referred to as positive.
    2. Neutrons (중성자)
        Neutrons carry not charge.
    3. Electrons (전자)
        Electrons carry a type of charge referred to as negative.
    
    Nucleus : Protons and Neutrons, there two paricels are contained within a very small volume of the atom.

## Deginitions
    A conducting material: A material on which charge move easily.
        ex) Metals.
    An insulating material: A meterial on which charge does not move much at all.
        ex) Rubber and plastic.
