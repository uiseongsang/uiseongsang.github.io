An electroscope is a scientific instrument used to detect the presence and magnitude of electric charge on a body. It was the first electrical measuring instrument.

# Investigation #2 : Charge Diagrams    
    >> intro
        One of the important issues in constructing a charge diagram is knowing the excess charge on an object
        charge: objects that interact this way to have a property.

## Three different subatomic particles
    1. Protons (양성자)
        Protons carry a type of charge referred to as positive.
    2. Neutrons (중성자)
        Neutrons carry not charge.
    3. Electrons (전자)
        Electrons carry a type of charge referred to as negative.
    
    Nucleus : Protons and Neutrons, there two paricels are contained within a very small volume of the atom.

## Deginitions
    A conducting material: A material on which charge move easily.
        ex) Metals.
    An insulating material: A meterial on which charge does not move much at all.
        ex) Rubber and plastic.


# Investigation #3 : Charging By Friction and Contact
    >> object
        To investigate two of the three methods of transferring electric charge to an object.
## Charging by Friction

The acrylic rod is charged by rubbing with the paper towel.
Before I rubbed the acrylic rod with the paper towel, zero excess charge on the paper and the rod.

From the lab, acrylic rod acquires an excess `positive charge` when it is rubbed with a paper towel, and plastic ruler acquires an acquires an excess `negative charge` when rubbed with a paper towel.

## Charging by Contact
