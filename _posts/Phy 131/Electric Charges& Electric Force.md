## Electric Charges & Electric Force         (chapter 22)
Electrons and protons--the constituents(구성) of amtoms-- are the basic charges of ordinary matter.

- electrons(negative charged) = -e: 1.6*10^-19C(coulombs)
- protrons(positive charged) = e: 1.6*10^-19C(coulombs)

#### netural atom
    num of protons = num of electrons
    net charge = 0
    excess charge = 0

#### Charge Conservation and Charge Diagrams 
    Law of conservation of charge: 
        - Charge is neither created nor destoryed.
        - Charge can be transferred from one object to another as electron and ions move about, but the total amount of charge remains constant.

        ex) plastic rod is rubbed with wool
            The wool is left with a positive charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the negative charge of the rod:
            q(wool) = -q(plastic)

### 22.3 Insulators and Conductors

    A conducting material: A material on which charge move easily.
        ex) Metals.
        - Metals usually cannot be charged by rubbing. 
        - Metals can be charged by contact with a charged plastic rod.

        An isolated conductor : any metal object not connected to or not in contact with any other conductor. It can be of any shape. It has following properties : There is no charge of any nature within the surface of the conductor

    An insulating material: A meterial on which charge does not move much at all.
        ex) Rubber and plastic.
        - Insulators are often charged by rubbing.

electrostatic(도체 중을 이동하지 않는 전하에 적용되는 용어. 즉, 정전(기)의 의미)
electrostatic equilibrium : The charges are at rest and there is no net force on any charge.

#### Discharging
    The human body consists largely of salt water, so humans are reasonably good conductors.
    The other hands, Pure water is not a terribly good conductor.

    Touching a charged metal

This picture shows us that human has much larger conducotr than the metal alone.
So the metal, for most practical purposes, is discharged.
