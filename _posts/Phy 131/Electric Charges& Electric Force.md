## Electric Charges & Electric Force         (chapter 22)
Electrons and protons--the constituents(구성) of amtoms-- are the basic charges of ordinary matter.

electrons(negative charged) = -e: -1.6*10^-19C(coulombs)
protrons(positive charged) = e: 1.6*10^-19C(coulombs)

#### netural atom
    num of protons = num of electrons
    net charge = 0
    excess charge = 0

#### Charge Conservation and Charge Diagrams 
    Law of conservation of charge: 
        - Charge is neither created nor destoryed.
        - Charge can be transferred from one object to another as electron and ions move about, but the total amount of charge remains constant.

        ex) plastic rod is rubbed with wool
            The wool is left with a positive charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the negative charge of the rod:
            q(wool) = -q(plastic)

### 22.3 Insulators and Conductors

        - The electrons in the insulator are all tightly bound to the positive nuclei and not free to move around.       - Insulators are often charged by rubbing.

        - The electrons in the conductor are free to move.

## Charging
    Insulators are often charged by rubbing.
